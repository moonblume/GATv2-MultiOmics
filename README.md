# GATv2-MultiOmics-BladderCancer

## Repository Name
GATv2-MultiOmics

## Description
This repository contains the implementation of "Multi-omics Data Integration for Bladder Cancer Subtype Classification Using GATv2 Graph Neural Networks." The project leverages advanced graph neural networks to enhance the classification of bladder cancer subtypes by integrating multi-omics data.

## Overview
This study introduces GATv2, a novel approach utilizing Graph Attention Networks (GAT) for the integration of multi-omics data, aiming to improve bladder cancer subtype classification. By incorporating a multi-head attention mechanism, GATv2 optimizes information extraction and assigns unique attention coefficients based on pairwise metrics, enhancing the model's predictive accuracy and robustness.
